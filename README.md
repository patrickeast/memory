#Hey Arnold! Memory Game

Test your short-term memory with this fun throw-back to a popular 90's Nickelodeon show, _Hey Arnold!_. The game uses *ReactJS* to modularize and build out the application.

##Play the Game <a href="https://memory-nickelodeon.herokuapp.com/">Here</a>
While the game is hosted on GitHub, I wanted it deployed to Heroku, just to decrease load times.

##Dependencies
React
React-dom
React-scripts
<hr>
*That's it!* See how cool React is?

##To run the game locally...
Feel free to update the game and/or switch out the theme and JSON with your own style and data. To get it up and going, run the following in your Terminal/Bash Window:
<ol>
<li><code>git clone git@github.com:patrickeast/memory.git</code></li>
<li><code>cd memory</code></li>
<li><code>yarn install</code></li>
<li><code>yarn start</code></li>
</ol>

#Considerations
Thanks to Felix Moon's (<a href="https://github.com/fdmoon">GitHub</a>) click-based memory game to get me started on this project, specifically with shuffling the cards around on-click.
